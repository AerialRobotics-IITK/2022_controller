# Creating Controllers

> Replace this text and below.

Filesystem finally must be of the form:

```bash
README.md
capacitor_voltage_control
    |_ Some files inside this, include the .cpp and the graph generated
simplified_inverted_pendulum_control
    |_ Include .slx file, and graph generated by the scope
uav_elevation_control
    |_ Include .slx file, and graph generated by the scope
```

## Approach to Control Design

> Replace this text and below.



Mathematical modelling, understanding Transfer functions, need for controller. Explain all these and more here.
This must be done by Pulak, Monkesh, Shivam and Devesh together.

Make seperate folders for each problem statements, each folder name must match with the following topic names.

## Problem Statements

### Capacitor Voltage Control

> Replace this text and below.

Explanation of what you did goes here, include the capacitor control problem statement here, explaining both
the problem and how you approached it. This should be done by **Monkesh**.

### Simplified Inverted Pendulum Control

> Replace this text and below.

Explanation of what you did goes here, include the Problem statement of Inverted Pendulum here, explaining both
the problem and how you approached it. This should be done by **Pulak**.

### UAV Elevation Control
>Problem Statement:

In the UAV Elevation Control Problem, we want the drone will adject its hight according to sinusoidal input (sin(wt)).we will be providing hight as a sinusoidal function and the drone will continuously changing its height according to the input. we will considaring only 1 D motion (upward and downward) of drone.

>Approch:

we will be considering the total upward trust(of 4 rotors) as linear function of input current to the motor. A transfer function is made which takes current( given to motors) and transfer it to a height( which can be achievied by applying the same curreny to motors in physical drone). A PID feedback control system is implemented which take height of drone as input (with the help of sensors installed in drone) and compare it with the refrance height at that time and give a output current which will be transformed into height through transfer function and again the PID will campare it with the referance value.
After building the setup,PID control loop wil be tune with diffrent values of P,I,D Gains.
for the given set of values( mass etc), the obtained PID values are-
P : 1200
I : 6200
D : 800
